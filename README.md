## 🌟Project Overview
This AI-powered solution is designed to:
- 🏷️ Detect **product brand names**.
- 🍃 Assess **freshness levels**.
- 📅 Extract **expiry dates** from product images.  

---

## ✨Key Features

### 🏷️Brand Name Detection
- Uses **YOLO** to detect product's text regions.
- Extracts **brand names**, **product type**, and **flavor details** using **PaddleOCR**.

### 🍃Freshness Detection
- Identifies **unpacked products** and assesses appearance using **YOLO** and **ResNet** for identifying the freshness of the item.
- Predicts **freshness levels** based on visual cues.
- Estimates **remaining shelf life** with lifespan prediction models.

### 📅Expiry Date Detection
- Utilizes **YOLO** for bounding regions containing expiry dates.
- Combines **Faster R-CNN with ResNet45** for text extraction.
- Verifies and parses **date-like patterns** using regex-based **DMY detection**.

---
